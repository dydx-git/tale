The authors in this book don't tire you. The sentences are simple, the stories are relatable and well-written. Throughout the book Linda & Robin take you through a journey telling different tales of people from all walks of life each time repeating the same theme: Grit makes it work!
As the title suggests this book uses science and research to enforce the idea of grit. Grit simply means to persevere against the odds and against your lazy-self.
