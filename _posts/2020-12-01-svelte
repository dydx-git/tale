I'm a sucker for underdogs. I love to give them a chance. When learning something new I'd much rather go for a better but lesser known framework. 
Of course, something only being off the beaten track shouldn't be the only attribute it should have. It should also be better than its more popular counterpart.

And svelte fits the bill 

So, to get started:
1. Open the PSD file that you downloaded from the above link.

2. Hide layers to get the exact appearance you want. But don't hide the color layer (if exists). We need that. 

![hide-useless-layers][hide-useless-layers]

3. Select layers that you want to make transparent. Please do NOT select Background layer as we need that. Right-click and Merge Layer. 

![merge-layers][merge-layers]

4. Right-click on the newly-created layer and select Blending Options 

![blending-options][blending-options]

5. Change the Knockout to Deep and the Opacity slider controls the transparency. Personally, I like to set it to anywhere from 30-50. 

![knockout-effect][knockout-effect]

The final result should look like this: 

![final][final]

[hide-useless-layers]: ../images/hide-useless-layers.png
[merge-layers]: ../images/merge-layers.png
[blending-options]: ../images/blending-options.png
[knockout-effect]: ../images/knockout-effect.png
[final]: ../images/final.png
