Here's a post to remind me of what I've learned so far. I'll keep updating this post as I move forward.

## A few definitions
### Labels
Labels are what we're trying to predict with the model. For example, if we're classifying among animals/objects, then what the system predicts will be the label.
The concept of label stays the same among most machine learning methods.

### Features
Features are what we use as input to the model. 
Say that we want to predict a movie recommendation: we could give genre, characters, and correlation of other people having the same taste as features for the model to try to predict a good recommendation.

### Classification vs Regression
Classification is used to predict discrete categories/labels. Like if a it's a shoe or sandal, if it's a person or animal etc. Whereas regression refers to predicting continuous values like the stock value of a company, or perhaps the estimated price of a property.

### Loss
The most basic type of Classification and Regression is there linear types.
By linear classification, we mean a graph like this:  
### Gradient Descent

### Learning Rate

## Pandas Basics
