Here's a post to remind me of what I've learned so far. I'll keep updating this post as I move forward.

## A few definitions
### Labels
Labels are what we're trying to predict with the model. For example, if we're classifying among animals/objects, then what the system predicts will be the label.
The concept of label stays the same among most machine learning methods.

### Features
Features are what we use as input to the model. 
Say that we want to predict a movie recommendation: we could give genre, characters, and correlation of other people having the same taste as features for the model to try to predict a good recommendation.

~~### Loss
The most basic type of Classification and Regression is there linear types.
By linear classification, we mean a graph like this:  
### Gradient Descent

~~### Learning Rate

~~## Pandas Basics

## Basic Machine Learning Tools/Methods

### Classification
For a classification task, a data mining procedure produces a model that, given a new individual, determines which class that individual belongs to. Classification and scoring are very closely related; as we shall see, a model that can do one can usually be modified to do the other.

### Regression
Also called "Value Estimation". A regression procedure produces a model that, given an individual, estimates the value of the particular variable specific to that individual.


* #### Classification vs Regression
Classification is used to predict discrete categories/labels. Like if a it's a shoe or sandal, if it's a person or animal etc. Whereas regression refers to predicting continuous values like the stock value of a company, or perhaps the estimated price of a property.
Regression is related to classification, but the two are different. Informally, classi‐
fication predicts whether something will happen, whereas regression predicts how
much something will happen.

### Similarity Matching
Similarity matching attempts to identify similar individuals based on data known
about them. Similarity matching can be used directly to find similar entities.

### Clustering
Clustering attempts to group individuals in a population together by their similarity,
but not driven by any specific purpose. Clustering is useful in pre‐liminary domain exploration to see which natural groups exist.

### Association Rules
This method attempts to find associations between entities based on transactions involving them. An example co-occurrence question would be: What items are commonly purchased together? 

* #### Clustering vs Association Rules
While clustering looks at similarity between objects based on the objects’ attributes, co-occurrence grouping considers similarity of objects based on their appearing together in transactions.
