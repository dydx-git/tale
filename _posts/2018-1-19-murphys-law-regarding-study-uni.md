# Introduction
While not a typical law which can be proven by mathematical equations or supposition, Murphy's law holds its own in nature and life. 

# Statement
This law is usually defined as:

**<cite>Anything that can go wrong, WILL go wrong</cite>** or 
**<cite>Everything takes longer than you think.</cite>**

# Spin-offs
* When you're desperate to solve a problem, you will NOT find its solution.
* If you take one day off of your class, every important thing would have happened on that day.
* If you're running late for class, forget about finding a parking spot.
* Your favourite class will be the one that brings down your GPA and you'll end up failing that class.
* The one thing that you skipped during your exam preparation will either be question number 1 or 2 on the test.
* That tricky math questions that you practiced for 8 hours? Yeah, it's not coming in the test tomorrow.
* The printer is always out of paper when you need to print.
* All professors assume their class is the most important class.
* When you really want to study, one of your friends will be giving a treat.
* When reviewing your notes before an exam, the most important ones will not be found.
* 80% of the exam will be based on the one lecture you missed about the one book you didn't read.

# Conclusion
While one may regard Murphy's Law as a humorous way of proposing life but in my opinion, it holds true under most circumstances. But that doesn't mean it IS. What I really wanna say here though is that: Take it or leave it. Following this law isn't hurting you but it's not helping either! =)
