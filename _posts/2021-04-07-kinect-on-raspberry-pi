Windows is what I usually use. It's what I grew up with. It's what I know best. Nevertheless, it hasn't adapted very well to ARM. There have been push to bring Windows 10 to ARM from Microsoft since 2017 but 
those haven't been very successful. Hence, it's really hard to get Windows to run on a microcomputer like Raspberry Pi. So, going with Linux was the obvious choice. 

I wanted to interact with my Pi using hands-free gestures so I went with a Kinect for tracking my hands (which I later realized is succeeded by PoseNet). 

Here's how you would go about setting it up and running on Raspberry Pi OS:

## Hook it up
Plug the device in then run `lsusb -v -d 045e:02ae | grep -e "Bus\|iSerial"` or simply `lsusb -v` as `sudo` and if you see something like this:
```bash
iManufacturer           2 Microsoft
iProduct                1 Xbox NUI Camera
iSerial                 3 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
Then Linux recognizes your Kinect.

## Installing dependencies
Install the following dependencies before attempting to install `libfreenect`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git-core cmake freeglut3-dev pkg-config build-essential libxmu-dev libxi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```
