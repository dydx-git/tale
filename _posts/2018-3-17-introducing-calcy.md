## Who's Calcy?
Calcy is a pure python based scientific calculator. We used Tkinter for its UI (which iyk is pretty ugly), we made extensive use of images to give a more non-generic look and feel to our calculator.

## Is it commercial?
Calcy was only a first-year college project so no, it's not a commercial software. Although, it supports many scientific functions it isn't complete at all.

## Coding Styles
I just started learning python last year, and no OOP was involved so the coding style is pretty linear. Although, I've tried my best to keep the code as systematic and clean as possible.

## Can I get the code?
Absolutely! Here's [where](https://github.com/dydx-git/Calcy) to get it!
