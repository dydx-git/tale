I'm now in my final semester. Almost through. Guess this is as good a time as any to follow up on this post I wrote when I was a freshie. I wanted to write sooner.. like way sooner but
I'd always stop because I thought there was never any substantial realization that put me on a different approach than what I described in part 1. My analysis back then was that it's not possible for me to balance all 4 portions of my life:
* Good grades
* Work Performance
* Social Life
* Sleep

And I kinda agree. You can't really satisfy the square. But then I did get through 4 years of doing just that.. juggling among these 4 things and somehow at the end of it all, found the square all balanced. My sleep schedule was so bad at one point that I'd wake 12-14 hours later on the weekends after a full week of pulling 3-hour shut-eyes. I didn't prepare for university quizzes apart from what I did at uni and a little bit in my break at work. I did take a week off during semester finals so at least that helped. 

Speaking of help, the nature of work that I did changed. I used to be in sales and it was so exhausting. I used to dread going to work but I finally learned some PHP and got into webdev. My colleagues at work would cover for me few times during my exams or if I was running late or feeling under the weather etc. Not to mention, my cousin helped me so much to the point where I sorta feel indebt to him. 

And I thought if I only focused on my work and studies, I'd miss out on my social life and like other things in this post, that also has some truth in it. But, the people I now call my friends are one of the most genuine people I know. They're people I feel comfortable being myself. I guess, it also helped that I was never reserved in asking for help. I'd always reach out whenever I needed to vent or to calm or something. 

And finally, my sleep. The one thing I decided in my first post in this series to not compromise on. And God knows how much I've compromised on it.
