I'm just your regular friendly neighborhood teenage dreamer ;)
I've a huge passion for knowledge. I love reading books, both fictional and non-fictional. I despise arrogant humans. I love pop and electronic music. I like to think that I'm rational and objective in my everyday dealings. I'm of a humanist view. I have a deep curiosity about Islam and I'm a proud muslim. 

I study at a public university in Karachi: NEDUET in the disc. of Computer Information Systems Engineering (CIS 2017-18 batch). This is my personal blog that I'll use to discover more about the computers and the world around me. This blog is a platform for me to speak out my opinions at lengths and find myself.
